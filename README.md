Hi ! I've been learning and practising web-development for 5 years. Currently working as a Software Developer.
Technologies that I have already covered are: HTML, CSS (sass), Javascript / Typescript, React / Redux, GOJS for diagramming.
As well as Express.js / Node, MangoDB for creating backend. I'm familiar with GIT and different approaches to version control.
 love new challenges and learning about new technologies, methods and approaches
to coding.
