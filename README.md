Hi ! I've been learning web-development for 2 years. I have already done a few projects and currently looking for a job.
Technologies that I have already covered are: HTML, CSS (sass), Javascript as well as Typescript, React / Redux.
As well as Express.js / Node, MangoDB for creating backend. I'm familiar with GIT and different approaches to version control.
Working in a team is not a problem for me. I love new challenges and learning about new technologies, methods and approaches
to coding.
